"""Cleaning and validation layer.

Two passes:

* ``budget_records.clean_budget_records`` — pandas-level fixes (null
  placeholders, currency casing, permissive coercion, hash-based dedup).
* ``policy.validate_with_policy`` — Pandera-level field/cross-column checks,
  routing failures into valid / quarantined / discarded partitions.

The split is deliberate: cleaning shapes the data, validation gatekeeps it.
