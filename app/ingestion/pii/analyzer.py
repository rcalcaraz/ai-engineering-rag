"""Presidio AnalyzerEngine factory configured for Spanish text.

The default Presidio configuration ships with English spaCy models. On Hispanic
names ("Laura Fernández", "Javier Romero") it silently returns *zero* PERSON
entities — a failure mode that is much worse than a false positive because it
goes undetected. This module is the single place that wires Presidio to
``es_core_news_md``.

The live session uses this module by first SHOWING the failure with the
default configuration and THEN replacing it with this one.
