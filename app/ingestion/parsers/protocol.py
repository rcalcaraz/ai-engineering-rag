"""The :class:`Parser` protocol and the :class:`ParseContext` passed to it.

Why a Protocol instead of an abstract base class? Two reasons:

* Parsers share no implementation — there is no useful method to inherit.
* Structural typing makes it trivial to drop in a fake during tests without
  inheriting from anything; any class with ``supported_formats`` and ``parse``
  satisfies the contract.
