"""Session 6 ingestion subsystem.

Three conceptual layers, each in its own subpackage:

* ``catalog`` — versioned audit of data sources (what we ingest and why).
* ``loaders`` + ``parsers`` — raw bytes → list[Document] (the canonical contract).
* ``cleaning`` + ``pii`` — tabular validation and GDPR pseudonymization.

The HTTP entry point lives in ``app.routers.ingestion``; the offline glue that
ties everything together lives in ``app.ingestion.orchestrator``.
